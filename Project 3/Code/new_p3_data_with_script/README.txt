These are the 30 posted test cases for Project 3. Each is worth 1 point,
for a total of 30 points. There is no partial credit for the test cases.
Each test case is all or nothing. For each test_i.txt, where i = 1, 2, ...
30, there is a corresponding o_test_i.txt. So test_5.txt contains the 
commands for posted test case 5, and o_test_5.txt contains
the expected output for the commands in test_5.txt. Your output must match
the output of all of the o_test_i.txt's EXACTLY.

All 30 posted test cases provided use a graph with 25 vertices and 50 weighted 
+ directed edges. To make visualizing the graph easier, we have provided a
graph.png image that shows you a figure corresponding to the graph.

I altered the input format a little from "W" to "write", from "F" to "find" and
from "S" to "stop".  The program echos the command (though please do so in the 
form so it doesn't look like shouting:

Command: <echo command here>
<output of command>
<blank line>

We'll make the sample solution produce output in this format but, for now, I 
think you understand what's requested.

Good luck.
